# Market-Basket-Analysis-Groceries-Dataset (with Python & R)
> In this project I tried to predict purchasing behaviour of customers using apriori algorithm (Association Rule). This rule shows how frequently an itemset occurs in a transaction and can be used to predict what a customer will buy next. 
* the project is built with both Python and R. 


## General Information
- Association Rule Mining is a Data Mining technique that finds patterns in data.
- The patterns found by Association Rule Mining represent relationships between items. When this is used with sales data, it is referred to as Market Basket Analysis.  It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy.
